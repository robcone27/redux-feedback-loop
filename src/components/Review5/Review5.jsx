// The Review step needs to have a submit button which will be clicked on to actually submit the 
// completed feedback to the server.

// When the submit button is clicked, save the submission in the database. The user should see a 
// submission success page. They can then click the button to take a new survey, which needs to 
// reset all the data and go back to the first step.
